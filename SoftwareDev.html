                <h2>Previous Projects</h2>

                <p>Don't just take our word for it—see some of the projects we’ve completed for
                our clients.</p>

                <h3>Mailing Server</h3>

                <p>A company approached us for assistance in creating a program to streamline the
                process of sending mail to their customers. For this project, we utilised Rust for
                the main logic and a MySQL database to store customer emails. The code was
                developed as a CLI tool, as requested, and includes a PKGBUILD, making
                installation straightforward.</p>

                <h3>Backend Development and Deployment</h3>

                <p>Another client was developing a mobile app designed to help students acclimate
                to university life and navigate the campus. They sought our expertise in
                developing a backend API to handle user logic such as login, registration,
                and user deletion. Additionally, they requested our assistance with deploying
                the app to the cloud using Kubernetes. They received a scalable
                and secure API that will serve them well for many years to come.</p>

                <h3>Cryptographic Research</h3>

                <p>Cutting-edge research is one of our passions. We have been involved in advancing
                hierarchical identity-based encryption, as well as testing lightweight cryptographic
                ciphers for use in constrained environments. The primary use case for this research
                is in ad-hoc IoT networks, where low power consumption is crucial.</p>

                function adjustBackgroundHeight() {
                    var page = document.querySelector('.page');
                    var backgroundWrapper = document.querySelector('.background-wrapper');
                    backgroundWrapper.style.height = page.offsetHeight + 'px';
                }

                window.addEventListener('load', adjustBackgroundHeight);
                window.addEventListener('resize', adjustBackgroundHeight);

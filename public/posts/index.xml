      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog to share my ideas and try to articulate what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. Before this iteration of the blog, I tried using a template YAML file within JavaScript to create blog posts. This approach was terrible; it was hard to see any syntax or even format it properly afterward. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s better to use already developed tools and techniques. That&amp;rsquo;s where I found an amazing video by NetworkChuck about setting up a content pipeline using Obsidian to create the Markdown files for a blog, and using a templater such as Hugo to turn them into pretty webpages like the one you are reading now. In this post, I will go over the steps I took to create this blog, and hopefully inspire you to create one as it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <h1>Get an Overview of Your Business's Security</h1>

                <p>At Zeos Systems, we offer a comprehensive vulnerability assessment designed to
                identify and categorize risks present in your company's IT infrastructure. By
                prioritizing these vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact,
                companies can focus on addressing the most critical threats first, significantly
                reducing their risk of data breaches and other security incidents. Additionally,
                many industries are subject to regulations and standards that require regular
                vulnerability assessments to maintain compliance.</p>

                <p>Conducting these assessments regularly allows your organization to continuously
                monitor and improve your security posture, providing valuable data for the development
                of robust security policies and procedures. Organizations that actively manage
                vulnerabilities can reduce the risk of cyberattacks by addressing known weaknesses
                before they can be exploited. A report by EC-Council highlights that around 60%
                of breaches are linked to unpatched vulnerabilities, underscoring the importance
                of regular and thorough vulnerability assessments to mitigate these risks
                <a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/conduct-a-vulnerability-analysis/">(EC-Council)</a>.</p>

                <h1>Receive a Comprehensive Report on Your Organization's Security</h1>

                addresses associated with the following devices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Servers (Web, Database, Mail, File)</li>

                health checks include a comprehensive review of your internal security
                policies, aligned with the UK Cyber Essentials scheme. We evaluate
                and provide recommendations for:</p>
                <ul>

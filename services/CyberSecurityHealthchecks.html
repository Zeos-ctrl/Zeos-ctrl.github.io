                <h1>Get an Overview of Your Business's Security</h1>

                <p>At Zeos Systems, we offer a comprehensive vulnerability assessment designed to
                identify and categorize risks present in your company's IT infrastructure. By
                prioritizing these vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact,
                companies can focus on addressing the most critical threats first, significantly
                reducing their risk of data breaches and other security incidents. Additionally,
                many industries are subject to regulations and standards that require regular
                vulnerability assessments to maintain compliance.</p>

                <p>Conducting these assessments regularly allows your organization to continuously
                monitor and improve your security posture, providing valuable data for the development
                of robust security policies and procedures. Organizations that actively manage
                vulnerabilities can reduce the risk of cyberattacks by addressing known weaknesses
                before they can be exploited. A report by EC-Council highlights that around 60%
                of breaches are linked to unpatched vulnerabilities, underscoring the importance
                of regular and thorough vulnerability assessments to mitigate these risks
                <a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/conduct-a-vulnerability-analysis/">(EC-Council)</a>.</p>

                <h1>Receive a Comprehensive Report on Your Organization's Security</h1>

                <h1>What Do We Scan and Check?</h1>
                <p>For our vulnerability assessment, we typically scan a set of IP
                addresses associated with the following devices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Servers (Web, Database, Mail, File)</li>
                    <li>Workstations and PCs</li>
                    <li>Network Routers and Switches</li>
                    <li>Firewalls</li>
                    <li>Virtual Machines</li>
                    <li>IoT Devices</li>
                    <li>Development and Test Servers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to our vulnerability assessments, our cybersecurity
                health checks include a comprehensive review of your internal security
                policies, aligned with the UK Cyber Essentials scheme. We evaluate
                and provide recommendations for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firewall Configuration and Management</li>
                    <li>Password Policies and Enforcement</li>
                    <li>Device Inventory and Management</li>
                    <li>User Management and Access Control</li>
                    <li>Patch Management and Software Updates</li>
                    <li>Data Protection and Backup Strategies</li>
                    <li>Incident Response Plans</li>
                </ul>

                policy review, we ensure that your organization is not only
                protected from technical vulnerabilities but also adheres to
                best practices in cybersecurity management.</p>

                <h1>Pricing</h1>

                <p>We offer two plans for Vulnerability Assessments tailored to
                your company's needs. The first option is a one-time payment, ideal
                for businesses that require a scan every six months or so. This is
                a cost-effective solution designed for companies with less frequent
                scanning needs. The second option is a monthly subscription, which
                includes regular network scans to keep your company continuously
                protected against the latest threats. The one-time payment starts
                at £200, with the final cost depending on your company's size,
                while the monthly subscription begins at £150, also adjusted based
                on your company's size.</p>

                <p>For our comprehensive Cyber Security Health Checks, we
                follow a similar pricing structure. A one-time assessment
                starts at £500, providing a thorough review of your security
                posture. Alternatively, you can opt for a subscription starting 
                at £400 per month, ensuring your company stays secure and up-to-date
                well into the future.</p>

                <h1>Software Solutions</h1>
                <p>At Zeos Systems, we create software products for academia and businesses, and as such, security is a fundamental component we build into our software from the outset.</p>
                <p>We have observed an increasing trend of applications moving to the cloud, which complicates the implementation of a zero-trust environment essential for keeping your data secure. At some point, your data is unencrypted on a server during processing, which inherently carries risks. Alongside this shift to the cloud, subscription models have become the predominant method for using software. This trend makes it increasingly difficult for users to truly own their software and data.</p>
                <p>In response to these challenges, we at Zeos Systems have decided to take a stand. We are committed to ensuring that our users retain control and ownership of their data. By processing data locally whenever possible and employing cutting-edge homomorphic encryption when the cloud is necessary, we ensure that data remains encrypted even while being processed. This revolutionary approach not only mitigates risks but also provides peace of mind to our users.</p>
                <p>Our dedication to security and data ownership is part of our broader mission to empower users with reliable, trustworthy, and innovative software solutions. We believe that by giving power back to the user, we are ushering in a new era of data ownership and security.</p>

                    <h2>Convergence</h2>
                    <p>Convergence is an AI-powered chat application that enables
                    seamless integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) without
                    requiring an internet connection. By running locally on your
                    computer, Convergence eliminates the need for a constant online
                    connection, allowing you to access and utilize LLM models in
                    real-time, regardless of your location or network status.
                    What's more, inspired by the innovative work of The Fabric
                    Project on GitHub, Convergence features a suite of customizable
                    prompts that empower users to personalize their experience and
                    tailor it to their unique needs and workflows.</p>
